# Create register picker

This is a tool for creating [pickers](https://github.com/alphagov/openregister-location-picker) based on [Registers](https://registers.cloudapps.digital/).

## Prerequisites

This is a Rails 5.1 app with [webpacker](http://github.com/rails/webpacker). Initially developed on the following (but likely works on other versions):

- Ruby `2.4.0p0`
- Bundler `1.15.2`
- node `v8.1.4`
- yarn `0.27.5`

## Installing and running locally

Install the Ruby and node.js dependencies:

```bash
bundle
yarn
```

Then run a server locally by running the following commands in two shells:

```bash
foreman start
```
> this will run `rails s` and `./bin/webpack-dev-server` for you so you dont have to do both manually

## Deploying

You'll need to have a [GOV.UK PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/) account configured with access to the `openregisters` organisation.

Run:

```bash
cf push create-register-picker
```
